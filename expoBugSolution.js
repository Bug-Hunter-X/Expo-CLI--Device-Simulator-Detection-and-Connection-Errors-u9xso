Troubleshooting steps to resolve Expo CLI device connection issues:

1. **Check Device/Simulator Connection:** Verify the device or simulator is properly connected and powered on.  For simulators, ensure the simulator is running and the correct device is selected.
2. **Network Connectivity:** Confirm stable network connectivity.  Expo may require network access for certain operations.
3. **Update Expo CLI:** Run `npm install -g expo-cli@latest` or `yarn global add expo-cli@latest` to ensure you're using the most recent version of the Expo CLI, which might contain fixes for device connectivity issues.
4. **Reinstall Expo CLI:** If updating doesn't work, try uninstalling and reinstalling the Expo CLI using the above commands. 
5. **Check Device Drivers:** If using a physical device, confirm that the appropriate device drivers are installed correctly on your system.  This is especially crucial for Android devices.
6. **Restart System:** A simple system restart can resolve temporary glitches affecting the Expo CLI.
7. **Check for conflicting software:** Ensure other software does not conflict with the Expo CLI or android emulators. 
8. **Verify Expo Go is installed and updated:** If you're using Expo Go, confirm it's installed and up-to-date on your device. 
9. **Examine Expo CLI Logs:** Check the complete log output from the Expo CLI for more detailed error messages and clues.  The logs often provide better context than the initial error message.
10. **Clean and Rebuild:** Try cleaning the project cache and rebuilding the project: `expo prebuild && expo run:android` (or `expo run:ios`).
11. **Check your expo configuration file:** Ensure there is no configuration error with your app.json or app.config.js
